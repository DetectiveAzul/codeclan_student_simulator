    <string name="tutorial_explanation">Hello player! This game puts you on the skin of a student on a intensive software developer course. You\'re changing careers, so your objective is to get to the end of the course to be able to get a new job. Course is 16 weeks long, so you need to keep focused and balanced all your stats to succeed. Remember, too much is as worse as too low.</string>

    <!-- End scene default description -->
    <string name="end_scene_win">You have succeeded on completing the whole intensive software developer program. You invested tons of time and money, but thanks to that, now you have become a junior developer</string>
    <string name="about_info">This app was developed during week 9 of the CodeClan intensive programming course. Based on a card game project brief, I have tweaked the idea into a simulation game. The player receives a card representing an event during the (parodic) daily life of a bootcamp student and their decision will affect a set of stats (money, sleep, anxiety, social life). If they are not balanced, they drop the course and the game will finish.

MVP is to have the Game logic developed in JAVA, and afterwards, as an extension, this will be transferred into a basic Android UI. As a final task, the ability to load/save the game and a ranking log with past game scores recorded with SQLite through Android Room.</string>
