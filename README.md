# CodeClan Student Simulator

This app was developed during week 9 of the CodeClan intensive programming course. Simulation game for Android devices. The player receives a card representing an event during the (parodic) daily life of a bootcamp student and their decision will affect a set of stats (money, sleep, anxiety, social life). If they are not balanced, they drop the course and the game will finish.

MVP is to have the Game logic developed in JAVA, and afterwards, as an extension, this will transferred into a basic Android UI. As a final task, the ability to load/save the game and to check a history log with past game scores recorded with SQLite. 

Live Demo of this Android App can be found on Google Play App Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.detectiveazul.codeclanstudentsimulator
