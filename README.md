# CodeClan Student Simulator

This app was developed during week 9 of the CodeClan intensive programming course. Based on the card game project brief (which rules are described below), I have tweaked the idea into a simulation game. The player receives a card representing an event during the (parodic) daily life of a bootcamp student and their decision will affect a set of stats (money, sleep, anxiety, social life). If they are not balanced, they drop the course and the game will finish.

MVP is to have the Game logic developed in JAVA, and afterwards, as an extension, this will transferred into a basic Android UI. As a final task, the ability to load/save the game and to check a history log with past game scores recorded with SQLite. 


## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.

## Card Game

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

### MVP
The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic already written. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

```
  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!
```

### Project Extensions

* Possibly add another card game
* Improve the UI
